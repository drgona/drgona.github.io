## Abstract 
At PNNL, I have led the development and demonstration of 
[differentiable predictive control (DPC)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959152422000981), a state-of-the-art advanced control method,
that enables rapid design and scalable deployment of predictive controls for
building energy systems. DPC provides benefits of 
[model predictive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) 
(MPC) at costs and complexity
of traditional controls allowing for improved control and predictions which result in reduced energy use,
demand flexibility and improved air quality. 
Under this project, my PNNL team collaborates with four industry partners to integrate
DPC with existing market-available control products to develop affordable, high-performance, and scalable
predictive control solutions that can be deployed in new and existing buildings to reduce energy, peak demand,
greenhouse gas emissions, and improve occupant comfort. The project will demonstrate the DPC
technology’s flexibility in design and deployment to industry use cases and underlying building energy
systems without substantial, bespoke rework. Performance and affordability of DPC supervisory control
solutions will be evaluated in more than four occupied, small, medium, and large commercial buildings
situated in various climate zones. Applied research will be directed by industry objectives to bring to the
market this new capability, and enable its broad deployment. The resulting buildings control technologies and
deployment enabling software will significantly advance BTO’s goals to reduce emissions in US buildings.
