### Abstract 
The objective of this project is to develop the mathematical foundations and framework for
controlling and optimizing complex systems by developing novel 
[scientific machine learning](https://sites.brown.edu/bergen-lab/research/what-is-sciml/) (SciML) methods. 
In US Department of Energy (DOE) mission areas, the analyses, simulations, and
optimizations of these complex systems have been the objectives of numerous past research efforts.
In this project, we recognize the fundamental challenge of complex system modeling and control,
which is that high-fidelity models can be prohibitively expensive to construct. 
This limitation is not necessarily due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying natural
phenomena but due to practical constraints such as the difficulties in instrumenting the complex
systems to collect relevant data, the need to resolve inherent uncertainties in the models (e.g., due
to unmodeled physics), and the loss of observability due to excessive exogenous noises. The general
applicability of the current solutions is hampered by the ad hoc nature of the approaches and the
lack of a coherent theoretical framework.
The new SciML methods developed under this project are adressing key challenges of complex systems: 
model construction, uncertainty quantification, decision and control,
and continual learning. 

The research in this project is conducted by researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory; 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; the University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Arizona State University. 


### Safe Data-driven Control

Under this project our team has developed a range of provably safe data-driven control methods
based on differentiable programming paradigm. 



### Open-source Software 

The technology developed under this project is being open-sourced 
as part of the Neuromancer Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) library developed by our team at PNNL.
