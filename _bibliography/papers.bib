    abstract={Modeling dynamical systems is crucial for a wide range of tasks, but it remains challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics, limited observations, or lack of prior knowledge. Recently, data-driven approaches such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) have shown promising results by leveraging the expressive power of neural networks to model unknown dynamics. However, these approaches often suffer from limited labeled training data, leading to poor generalization and suboptimal predictions. On the other hand, semi-supervised algorithms can utilize abundant unlabeled data and have demonstrated good performance in classification and regression tasks.
    We propose TS-NODE, the first semi-supervised approach to modeling dynamical systems with NODE. TS-NODE explores cheaply generated synthetic pseudo rollouts to broaden exploration in the state space and to tackle the challenges brought by lack of ground-truth system data under a teacher-student model. TS-NODE employs an unified optimization framework that corrects the teacher model based on the student’s feedback while mitigating the potential false system dynamics present in pseudo rollouts.
    TS-NODE demonstrates significant performance improvements over a baseline Neural ODE model on multiple dynamical system modeling tasks.}, number={14}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wang, Yu and Yin, Yuxuan and NS, Karthik Somayaji and Drgoňa, Ján and Schram, Malachi and Halappanavar, Mahantesh and Liu, Frank and Li, Peng},

    journal={Transactions on Machine Learning Research},
    abstract={Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the growing interest in
    deploying RL agents in real-world scenarios. A critical aspect of risk awareness involves modelling highly rare risk events (rewards) that
    could potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes. These infrequent occurrences present a formidable challenge for data-driven methods aiming
    to capture such risky events accurately. While risk-aware RL techniques do exist,
    they suffer from high variance estimation due to the inherent data scarcity. Our work proposes to enhance the resilience of RL agents when faced
    with very rare and risky events by focusing on refining the predictions of the extreme values predicted by the state-action value distribution.
    To achieve this, we formulate the extreme values of the state-action value function distribution as parameterized distributions,
    drawing inspiration from the principles of extreme value theory (EVT). We propose an extreme value theory based actor-critic approach, namely,
    Extreme Valued Actor-Critic (EVAC) which effectively addresses the issue of infrequent occurrence by leveraging EVT-based parameterization.
    Importantly, we theoretically demonstrate the advantages of employing these parameterized distributions in contrast to other risk-averse algorithms.
    Our evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms other risk averse RL algorithms on a diverse range of benchmark tasks, each encompassing distinct risk scenarios.},

    abstract={Normalizing flows (NF) build upon invertible neural networks and have wide applications in probabilistic modeling. Currently, building a powerful yet computationally efficient flow model relies on empirical fine-tuning over a large design space. While introducing neural architecture search (NAS) to NF is desirable, the invertibility constraint of NF brings new challenges to existing NAS methods whose application is limited to unstructured neural networks. Developing efficient NAS methods specifically for NF remains an open problem. We present AutoNF, the first automated NF architectural optimization framework. First, we present a new mixture distribution formulation that allows efficient differentiable architecture search of flow models without violating the invertibility constraint. Second, under the new formulation, we convert the original NP-hard combinatorial NF architectural optimization problem to an unconstrained continuous relaxation admitting the discrete optimal architectural solution, circumventing the loss of optimality due to binarization in architectural optimization. We evaluate AutoNF with various density estimation datasets and show its superior performance-cost trade-offs over a set of existing hand-crafted baselines.},

    abstract = {As buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions, their role in decarbonizing the power grid is crucial. The increased integration of variable energy sources, such as renewables, introduces uncertainties and unprecedented flexibilities, necessitating buildings to adapt their energy demand to enhance grid resiliency. Consequently, buildings must transition from passive energy consumers to active grid assets, providing demand flexibility and energy elasticity while maintaining occupant comfort and health. This fundamental shift demands advanced optimal control methods to manage escalating energy demand and avert power outages. Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising method to address these challenges. In this paper, we explore ten questions related to the application of RL in buildings, specifically targeting flexible energy management. We consider the growing availability of data, advancements in machine learning algorithms, open-source tools, and the practical deployment aspects associated with software and hardware requirements. Our objective is to deliver a comprehensive introduction to RL, present an overview of existing research and accomplishments, underscore the challenges and opportunities, and propose potential future research directions to expedite the adoption of RL for building energy management.}

However, insufficient consideration of domain knowledge can impose a high risk to the practicality of the methods. Specifically, ignoring the grid-specific spatiotemporal patterns (in load, generation, and topology, etc.) can lead to outputting infeasible, unrealizable, or completely meaningless predictions on new inputs. To address this concern, this paper investigates real-world operational data to provide insights into power grid behavioral patterns, including the time-varying topology, load, and generation, as well as the spatial differences (in peak hours, diverse styles) between individual loads and generations. Then based on these observations, we evaluate the generalization risks in some existing ML works caused by ignoring these grid-specific patterns in model design and training.},

abstract = {Dynamical systems see widespread use in natural sciences like physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as engineering disciplines such as circuit analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and control. For simple systems, the differential equations governing the dynamics can be derived by applying fundamental physical laws. However, for more complex systems, this approach becomes exceedingly difficult. Data-driven modeling is an alternative paradigm that seeks to learn an approximation of the dynamics of a system using observations of the true system. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in applying data-driven modeling techniques to solve a wide range of problems in physics and engineering. This article provides a survey of the different ways to construct models of dynamical systems using neural networks. In addition to the basic overview, we review the related literature and outline the most significant challenges from numerical simulations that this modeling paradigm must overcome. Based on the reviewed literature and identified challenges, we provide a discussion on promising research areas.},

For many such systems, nonlinearity drives populations of identical (or near-identical) units to exhibit a wide range of nontrivial behaviors, such as the emergence of coherent structures (e.g., waves and patterns) or otherwise notable dynamics (e.g., synchrony and chaos). In this work, we seek to infer (i) the intrinsic physics of a base unit of a population, (ii) the underlying graphical structure shared between units, and (iii) the coupling physics of a given networked dynamical system given observations of nodal states. These tasks are formulated around the notion of the Universal Differential Equation, whereby unknown dynamical systems can be approximated with neural networks, mathematical terms known a priori (albeit with unknown parameterizations), or combinations of the two. We demonstrate the value of these inference tasks by investigating not only future state predictions but also the inference of system behavior on varied network topologies. The effectiveness and utility of these methods are shown with their application to canonical networked nonlinear coupled oscillators.}",

In contrast, purely data-driven models require a large number of observations and lack operational guarantees for safety-critical systems. Data-driven models leveraging available partially characterized dynamics have potential to provide reliable systems models in a typical data-limited scenario for high value complex systems, thereby avoiding months of expensive expert modeling time. In this work we explore this middle-ground between expert-modeled and pure data-driven modeling. We present control-oriented parametric models with varying levels of domain-awareness that exploit known system structure and prior physics knowledge to create constrained deep neural dynamical system models. We employ universal differential equations to construct data-driven blackbox and graybox representations of the AUV dynamics. In addition, we explore a hybrid formulation that explicitly models the residual error related to imperfect graybox models. We compare the prediction performance of the learned models for different distributions of initial conditions and control inputs to assess their suitability for control.}

    abstract={Energy consumption in buildings, both residential and commercial, accounts for approximately 40% of all
    energy usage in the United States, and similar numbers are being reported from countries around the world.

    deriving important insights from data and optimizing various systems. In this work, we review some of the most promising

In the DPC framework, a neural state-space model is learned from time-series measurements of the system dynamics. The neural control policy is then optimized via stochastic gradient descent approach by differentiating the MPC loss function through the closed-loop system dynamics model. The proposed DPC method learns model-based control policies with state and input constraints, while supporting time-varying references and constraints. In embedded implementation using a Raspberry-Pi platform, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to train constrained control policies purely based on the measurements of the unknown nonlinear system. We compare the control performance of the DPC method against explicit MPC and report efficiency gains in online computational demands, memory requirements, policy complexity, and construction time. In particular, we show that our method scales linearly compared to exponential scalability of the explicit MPC solved via multiparametric programming.}

abstract = {The availability of computational power, and a wealth of data from sensors have boosted the development of model-based predictive control for smart and effective control of advanced buildings in the last decade. More recently occupant-behavior models have been developed for including people in the building control loops. However, while important objectives of scientific research are reproducibility and replicability of results, not all information is available from published documents. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a guideline for a thorough and standardized occupant-behavior model documentation. For that purpose, the literature screening for the existing occupant behavior models in building control was conducted, and the occupant behavior modeling processes were studied to extract practices and gaps for each of the following phases: problem statement, data collection, and preprocessing, model development, model evaluation, and model implementation. The literature screening pointed out that the current state-of-the-art on model documentation shows little unification, which poses a particular burden for the model application and replication in field studies. In addition to the standardized model documentation, this work presented a model-evaluation schema that enabled benchmarking of different models in field settings as well as the recommendations on how OB models are integrated with the building system.}

abstract = {The problem of synthesizing stochastic explicit model predictive control policies is known to be quickly intractable even for systems of modest complexity when using classical control-theoretic methods. To address this challenge, we present a scalable alternative called stochastic parametric differentiable predictive control (SP-DPC) for unsupervised learning of neural control policies governing stochastic linear systems subject to nonlinear chance constraints. SP-DPC is formulated as a deterministic approximation to the stochastic parametric constrained optimal control problem. This formulation allows us to directly compute the policy gradients via automatic differentiation of the problem's value function, evaluated over sampled parameters and uncertainties. In particular, the computed expectation of the SP-DPC problem's value function is back propagated through the closed-loop system rollouts parametrized by a known nominal system dynamics model and neural control policy which allows for direct model-based policy optimization. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed policy optimization algorithm in three numerical examples, including systems with a large number of states or subject to nonlinear constraints.}

The proposed method uses systematic encoding of physics-based prior knowledge into a structured recurrent neural architecture. Specifically, our method incorporates structural prior knowledge from traditional physics-based building modeling into the architecture of the deep neural network model. Further, we also use penalty methods to provide inequality constraints, thereby bounding predictions within physically realistic and safe operating ranges. We observe that stable eigenvalues accurately characterize the dissipativeness of the system, and use a constrained matrix parameterization based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem to bound the dominant eigenvalues of the building thermal model parameter matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and physical interpretability of the proposed data-driven modeling approach on a real-world dataset obtained from an office building with 20 thermal zones. The proposed data-driven method can learn interpretable dynamical models that achieve high accuracy and generalization over long-term prediction horizons. We show that using only 10 days’ measurements for training, our method is capable of generalizing over 20 consecutive days. We demonstrate that the proposed modeling methodology is achieving state-of-the-art performance by significantly improving the accuracy and generalization compared to classical system identification methods and prior advanced methods reported in the literature. compared to prior state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature.}

However, in the absence of complete prior knowledge of a dynamical system’s physical characteristics, determining the optimal structure and optimization strategy for these models can be difficult. In this work, we explore methods for discovering neural state space dynamics models for system identification. Starting with a design space of block-oriented state space models and structured linear maps with strong physical priors, we encode these components into a model genome alongside network structure, penalty constraints, and optimization hyperparameters. Demonstrating the overall utility of the design space, we employ an asynchronous genetic search algorithm that alternates between model selection and optimization and obtains accurate physically consistent models of three physical systems: an aerodynamics body, a continuous stirred tank reactor, and a two tank interacting system.}

DPC poses an approximate solution to multiparametric programming problems emerging from explicit nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Contrary to approximate MPC, DPC does not require supervision by an expert controller. Instead, a system dynamics model is learned from the observed system’s dynamics, and the neural control law is optimized offline by leveraging the differentiable closed-loop system model. The combination of a differentiable closed-loop system and penalty methods for constraint handling of system outputs and inputs allows us to optimize the control law’s parameters directly by backpropagating economic MPC loss through the learned system model. The control performance of the proposed DPC method is demonstrated in simulation using learned model of multi-zone building thermal dynamics.}

However, the deployment of MPC in a large portion of the building stock has not been possible partially because of high installation costs. Every building is unique and requires a tailored MPC solution. The best performing solutions are often based on physics-based modeling, which is, however, computationally expensive and requires dedicated software. A promising direction that tackles this problem is to train a neural network-based optimal control policy to imitate the behavior of physics-based MPC from the simulation data generated offline. The neural networks give control actions that closely approximate those produced by physics-based MPC, but with a fraction of the computational and memory requirements and without the need for licensed software. The main advantage of the proposed approach stems from simple evaluation at execution time, leading to low computational foot-prints and easy deployment on embedded HW platforms. In the case study, we present the energy savings potential of physics-based MPC applied to an office building in Belgium. We demonstrate how neural network approximators can be used to cut the implementation and maintenance costs of MPC deployment without compromising performance. We also critically assess the presented approach by pointing out the remaining challenges and open research questions.}",

Abs= {Model predictive control (MPC) has been proven in simulations and pilot case studies to be a superior control strategy for large buildings. MPC can utilize the weather and occupancy schedule forecasts, together with the system model, to predict the future thermal behavior of the building and minimize the overall energy use and maximize thermal comfort. However, these advantages come with the cost of increased modeling effort, computational demands, communication infrastructure, and commissioning efforts. Thus a typical approach is to, often rapidly, simplify the building modeling and MPC optimization problem while paying a price of not reaching the full performance potential. It has been shown that by employing accurate physics-based models, MPC performance can be notably increased closer to its theoretical performance bound. However, implementation of such high-fidelity MPC in real buildings remains a challenge, resulting in a lack of successful field test studies. This work presents the methodology and field test demonstration of a computationally efficient implementation of the white-box MPC in an office building in Belgium. The detailed model of the building is based on first-principle physical equations. The deployment and supervision of MPC operation in a practical setting are supported by an automated cloud-based communication infrastructure. The motivating factor behind the cloud-based architecture is its compatibility with a commercially appealing control as a service concept. The building is equipped with a ground source heat pump (GSHP) and thermally activated building structures (TABS), where the combination of both is also known as GEOTABS. From a control perspective, GEOTABS buildings are particularly challenging systems due to large scale, complex heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and slow dynamics with time delays. On the other hand, there is an increased potential for energy savings due to the high thermal mass, which acts as thermal storage. The MPC operation is demonstrated during the challenging transient seasons (switching between heating and cooling), and its performance is compared to a traditional rule-based controller (RBC). We provide a proof of concept of real MPC operation for the most difficult seasons with notable GSHP energy use savings equal to 53.5% and thermal comfort improvement by 36.9%. Other MPC applications found in the literature describe tests for only cooling or only heating, and up to now only for a black-box or a grey-box approach.}

Abs= {It has been proven that advanced building control, like model predictive control (MPC), can notably reduce the energy use and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, despite intensive research efforts, the practical applications are still in the early stages. There is a growing need for multidisciplinary education on advanced control methods in the built environment to be accessible for a broad range of researchers and practitioners with different engineering backgrounds. This paper provides a unified framework for model predictive building control technology with focus on the real-world applications. From a theoretical point of view, this paper presents an overview of MPC formulations for building control, modeling paradigms and model types, together with algorithms necessary for real-life implementation. The paper categorizes the most notable MPC problem classes, links them with corresponding solution techniques, and provides an overview of methods for mitigation of the uncertainties for increased performance and robustness of MPC. From a practical point of view, this paper delivers an elaborate classification of the most important modeling, co-simulation, optimal control design, and optimization techniques, tools, and solvers suitable to tackle the MPC problems in the context of building climate control. On top of this, the paper presents the essential components of a practical implementation of MPC such as different control architectures and nuances of communication infrastructures within supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The paper draws practical guidelines with a generic workflow for implementation of MPC in real buildings aimed for contemporary adopters of this technology. Finally, the importance of standardized performance assessment and methodology for comparison of different building control algorithms is discussed.}

Abs= {Many studies have proven that the building sector can significantly benefit from replacing the current practice rule-based controllers (RBC) by more advanced control strategies like model predictive control (MPC). However, the optimization-based control algorithms, like MPC, impose increasing hardware and software requirements, together with more complicated error handling capabilities required from the commissioning staff. In recent years, several studies introduced promising remedy for these problems by using machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on devising simplified control laws learned from MPC. The main advantage of the proposed methods stems from their easy implementation even on low-level hardware. However, most of the reported studies were dealing only with problems with a limited complexity of the parametric space, and devising laws only for a single control variable, which inevitably limits their applicability to more complex building control problems. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework for synthesis of simple, yet well-performing control strategies that mimic the behavior of optimization-based controllers, also for large scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) control problems which are common in the building sector. The approach employs multivariate regression and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Particularly, deep time delay neural networks (TDNN) and regression trees (RT) are used to derive the dependency of multiple real-valued control inputs on parameters. The complexity of the problem, as well as implementation cost, are further reduced by selecting the most significant features from the set of parameters. This reduction is based on straightforward manual selection, principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic analysis of the building model. The approach is demonstrated on a case study employing temperature control in a six-zone building, described by a linear model with 286 states and 42 disturbances, resulting in an MPC problem with more than thousand of parameters. The results show that simplified control laws retain most of the performance of the complex MPC, while significantly decreasing the complexity and implementation cost.}

	Abs= {Modelling of geothermal borefields for building energy simulations (BES) has always been a complicated task due to the challenge of implementing both their short-term and long-term responses. Besides, in model-based optimal control of geothermal systems, a simplified version of a borefield control-oriented model is desired. Typical prediction horizons used in optimal control of buildings range from hours to a few days, inviting to reduce the complexity of the controller model down to the short-term range. However, the long-term thermal behaviour of the ground is crucial with respect to the heat pump COP and availability of direct cooling. In a white-box controller model, the states keep their physical meaning. Thus, the longterm dynamics can be captured from the model used for dynamic simulation, i.e. the emulator, and updated to the controller model at each optimisation time-step. Nevertheless, since in a real implementation the availability of data is much more limited a state estimator is necessary. In this paper, three state estimators (Stationary Kalman Filter, Time-Varying Kalman Filter and Moving Horizon Estimator) for a linear borehole model are compared using real data from a building combining a geothermal heat pump and a thermally activated building system (hybridGEOTABS). In general, all investigated linear estimators are capable of accurately estimating the ground states.},

Abs= {Optimal control of a CSTR represents a challenging task. The proposed paper discusses two issues. The first one addresses control of pH in a chemical vessel, where the reaction between sodium hydroxide and acetic acid occurs. The objective here is to improve control performance of a well tuned PI controller. It will be shown that this can be achieved by introducing a reference governor scheme. The second problem, elaborated in this paper, is the implementation of the reference governor paradigm. Concretely, we aim to design a fast and cheap MPC-based feedback controller. To achieve these goals, we exploit the region-less explicit technique, which efficiently reduces memory footprint issues of standard explicit MPC schemes. Such MPC-based reference governor was employed to control pH in the chemical vessel. Its control performance is compared with conventional PI controller. Finally, comparison of implementation requirements of region-less and region-based explicit techniques is investigated.}

Abs= {Model predictive control (MPC) for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings requires accurate controller models of the building envelope and its HVAC systems. Controller models are typically obtained by means of black- or grey-box system identification or using a white-box modelling approach. However, the necessary level of model complexity used by each method in order to obtain good MPC performance remains a priori unknown and no systematic method or examples showing the optimal complexity is available. This paper systematically investigates the required controller model complexity necessary to obtain optimal control performance for a given building. First, a 6-room house is modeled in detail using building energy simulation software. The building model is then linearized to obtain a linear time invariant (LTI) state-space model (SSM) and the upper bound of the control performance is computed using an MPC with the SSM both as controller and as plant model. The accuracy of the SSM (containing more than 250 states) is then artificially decreased by reducing its number of states to different orders ranging from 4 to 100 using balanced truncation model order reduction technique. The performances of MPCs using these controller models are then compared with the upper bound for both a standard MPC formulation (S-MPC) and an offset-free formulation (OSF-MPC) and with the performance of a rule-based-controller (RBC). The procedure is repeated for the same house model with a higher level of insulation and for a lighter weight construction. This paper shows that the controller model should contain a minimum of states to model each zone separately, and that the walls and floors separating the zones should also have enough states to act as a low pass filter with correct cut-off frequency. The minimum number of states further increases with the building mass content. In the case of the investigated 6-room house, the thermal comfort achieved by MPC using a controller model with a minimum of 30 states instead of 20 states was improved with a factor 2–6 without significant increase of the energy use, showing that good MPC performances require controller models with a significantly higher number of states than the order used by most of the black- and grey-box system identification techniques. The minimum required number of states might be chosen lower when OSF-MPC is used instead of conventional MPC. However, OSF-MPC might significantly increase the energy use when poor controller models (high model mismatch) are used. Furthermore, if the controller model is an LTI model, this paper shows that the CPU time necessary to solve the MPC optimization problem becomes independent of the number of states of the controller model when a dense approach is used. The controller model can thus be as complex as necessary to produce accurate predictions without increasing the computation time of the optimization.}

Abs = {This paper shows how to construct and implement explicit MPC feedback laws for systems with a large number of states. Specifically, the construction of critical regions of the explicit MPC solution is replaced by a two-step procedure. First, all optimal active sets are enumerated off-line and corresponding KKT matrices are pre-factored. Then, in the on-line step, the optimal control inputs are identified by checking primal and dual feasibility conditions using the pre-factored data. The feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are experimentally demonstrated on the control of the laboratory binary distillation column, described by a dynamical model with 10 state variables. We show that the control algorithm requires only modest computational resources on-line. A comparison of the memory and computational demands of the proposed method with the on-line solution of the corresponding quadratic program via the state-of-the-art solver as well as the approximated solution via the first-order method is made.}

The approach is based on employing regression trees to derive dependence of real-valued control inputs on measurements. Quality of classical regression policies is improved by finding, simultaneously, optimal affine splits and optimal local affine regressors. We furthermore illustrate how to refine the local regressors such that the overal feedback strategy guarantees satisfaction of input constraints. The main advantage of the proposed regression-based control strategy stems from its fast implementation even on very simple hardware. The approach is demonstrated on a case study that assumes control of temperature in a one-zone building. Here, the data used in the learning process are generated by MPC. We show that the simple feedback law attains almost the same level of performance as the complex MPC controller.}
