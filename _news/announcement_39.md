I had a packed program at the [ACC 2025](https://acc2025.a2c2.org/) in Denver, CO. 
I co-organized workshop on [Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Control](https://sites.google.com/view/acc-physics-informed-learning/program?authuser=0). 
I co-organized a tutorial session on [Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control](https://github.com/drgona/S-PIML_ACC2025).
I also presented my work on differentiable predictive control (DPC) in a tutorial session on  Learning Interpretable Control Policies: Unifying Reinforcement Learning, Differentiable Programming and Bayesian Optimization.
All my ACC slides are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/drgona/slides/tree/main/2025/ACC%202025).
