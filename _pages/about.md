I am an incoming associate professor in the [Department of Civil and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/).
and the [Ralph S. Oâ€™Connor Sustainable Energy Institute (ROSEI)](https://energyinstitute.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Currently, I serve as a Principal Investigator (PI) and Research Data Scientist at PNNL. 
My project portfolio is focused on 
[differentiable programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming) and [scientific
machine learning](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1478744/) (SciML) 
for dynamical systems, constrained optimization, and control.
I have developed technology roadmaps that contributed to the acquisition of 
a $20M project portfolio funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

I am a lead software developer of [Neuromancer SciML library in PyTorch](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer) 
for solving constrained optimization, physics-informed machine learning, and optimal control problems. 
Within two years, our library became the most popular open-source repository released by [PNNL](https://github.com/pnnl).
