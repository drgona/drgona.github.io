I am a Principal Investigator (PI) and Staff-level Research Scientist at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory (PNNL). My current project portfolio is focused on differentiable programming and scientific
machine learning (SciML) for dynamical systems, optimization, and control.
I have developed technology roadmaps that contributed to the acquisition of 
a $20M project portfolio funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

I am a lead software developer of [Neuromancer: a SciML library in PyTorch](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer) 
for solving constrained optimization, physics-informed machine learning, and optimal control problems. 
Within two years, our library became the most popular open-source repository released by PNNL.
