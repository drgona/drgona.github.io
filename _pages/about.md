I am an associate professor in the [Department of Civil and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
I hold a secondary appointment at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/), 
and I am the core faculty member of the [Ralph S. O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute (ROSEI)](https://energyinstitute.jhu.edu/),
and an affiliate of the [Data Science and AI Institute (DSAI)](https://ai.jhu.edu/).

Previously, I was a research data scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and
a postdoc at KU Leuven in Belgium. I did my PhD in process control from Slovak University of Technology.


My project portfolio is focused on 
[differentiable programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming) and [scientific
machine learning](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1478744/) (SciML) 
for dynamical systems, constrained optimization, and control with applications
to sustainable energy systems.

I am a lead software developer of [Neuromancer SciML library in PyTorch](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer) 
for solving constrained optimization, physics-informed machine learning, and optimal control problems.
